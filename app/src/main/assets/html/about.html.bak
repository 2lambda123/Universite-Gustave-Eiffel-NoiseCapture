    <h2>Description</h2>
    NoiseCapture is an Android App <b>research project</b> for measuring
    environmental noise using a smartphone. The goal is to produce relevant
    noise indicators from audio recordings, including a geospatial
    representation.
    <h2>Developments</h2>
    NoiseCapture is a collaboration between the <a title="LAE website" href="www.lae.ifsttar.fr">Environmental
      Acoustic Laboratory</a> (Ifsttar) and the <a title="Lab-STICC website" href="http://www.lab-sticc.fr/">Lab-STICC
      CNRS</a>.<br>
    <h2>Funding</h2>
    This application is co-funded by the <b>ENERGIC-OD Research Project</b>
    (European Network for Redistributing Geospatial Information to user
    Communities - Open Data). ENERGIC-OD (<a href="http://www.energic-od.eu/">http://www.energic-od.eu/</a>)
    is partially funded under the ICT Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) as part
    of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme by the European
    Community. The application work is also supported by the French geographic
    portal <b>GEOPAL</b> of the Pays de la Loire region (<a href="http://www.geopal.org">http://www.geopal.org</a>).
